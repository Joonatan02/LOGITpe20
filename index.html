        <li>2 pounds of whole-wheat macaroni</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of all purpose flour</li>
        <li>6 cups of milk,divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1(8 ounce) package of shredded cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup of Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>butter flavoured cooking spray</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How to make?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>     
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium-low heat. Slowly add flour to butter, whisking constantly; cook until brown and the mixture no longer smells of flour, about 5 minutes. Pour 1 cup milk into the flour mixture, whisking continually until fully incorporated, about 45 seconds; repeat twice. Add remaining 3 cups milk to the mixture, whisking to incorporate. Stir Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper into the mixture; season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low. Cook sauce, whisking frequently, until it begins to thicken, about 10 minutes. Add about half the package of shredded Cheddar cheese; stir continually until the cheese melts completely. Repeat with remaining half package of Cheddar cheese and the American cheese, about 4 ounces at a time. Once cheese is entirely incorporated, remove sauce from heat.</li>
        <li>Stir drained macaroni into the cheese sauce to coat. Divide macaroni between two 9x13-inch baking dishes.</li>
        <li>Mix crushed potato chips, 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, and Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Top the macaroni with the potato chip mixture evenly. Spray the potato chip mixture with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
